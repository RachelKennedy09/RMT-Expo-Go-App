1. faults - started a project with just create-expo-app without @latest and ran into lots of errors and warnings. restarted project with latest dependencies for smoother work for now and the future. Using the latest SDK demonstrates ability to initialize a modern RN/Expo environment and avoid peer-dependency conflicts.
